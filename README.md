## About Me
<div> I have been passionate about programming since high school, where I followed the mathematics-informatics profile, but I attended the faculty of balneo-physio-kinetic therapy. I worked in that field for about 3 years, but a year ago I decided to return to programming. Then I started looking for the best way to start a career in frontend development and I started with a course on Udemy to be able to remind myself of the basic notions learned in high school about HTML. The next course was an introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, a course accredited by the Ministry of Education, during which I prepared the projects from this repository. After finishing this course I tried to learn as much as possible on my own, I redid some of the projects and started a new course on Udemy, The Ultimate 2022 Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp, which is half finished.</div>

## Projects
<div> The projects in the course started with very easy projects, such as using links and images, to more complex things. I worked with flexbox, Bootstrap, APIs.
